# QuadGIS
## Quadtrees Implementation for Enhanced Decision Making in Geographic Information Systems

🚀 Project Overview
-------------------

**GeoQuad** is a Python-based Geographic Information System (GIS) application that enhances **emergency response decision-making** through efficient **spatial indexing using Quadtrees**. The system is designed to quickly locate critical emergency facilities—**hospitals**, **police stations**, and **fire stations**—in real-time using optimized search algorithms.

By integrating **Quadtrees** with **Dijkstra's**, **A\***, and **Euclidean distance** algorithms, GeoQuad enables **faster nearest-neighbor searches**. It also features a **Tkinter-based GUI** with an interactive map, allowing users to visualize emergency services across a city.

🧩 Key Features
---------------

*   ✅ **Quadtree-based spatial indexing** for efficient geographical partitioning.
    
*   ⚡ Supports **Dijkstra's**, **A\***, and **Euclidean** algorithms for pathfinding and performance comparison.
    
*   🏥 Fast querying of emergency services like hospitals, police stations, and fire stations.
    
*   🖥️ Desktop GUI using **Tkinter** and **TkinterMapView** for live map interaction.
    
*   📈 Visual representation of emergency facilities in **real-time**.
    
*   🧠 Built for use in **urban planning**, **disaster management**, and **smart city systems**.
    

📦 Dataset: Emergency Services in Bengaluru
-------------------------------------------

The application pulls **live OpenStreetMap data** using the **Overpass API** to fetch:

*   🏥 Hospitals
    
*   🚓 Police Stations
    
*   🚒 Fire Stations
    

Technologies Used

*   Python 
    
*   Tkinter (GUI)
    
*   TkinterMapView (OpenStreetMap integration)
    
*   Pandas (Data processing)
    
*   Requests (API calls)
    
*   Overpass API (for OSM queries)
    
*   Quadtree Data Structures
    
*   Dijkstra, A\*, and Euclidean Distance algorithms
    

Performance Insights

*   **Euclidean Distance** performs best in terms of query speed.
    
*   Quadtree indexing reduces search complexity dramatically in large datasets.
    
*   Ideal for high-density urban environments requiring fast emergency dispatch.
